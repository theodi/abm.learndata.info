This is generally driven by the research question. In our model, we set things like the importance of having previously consumed a product in consumer decisions &lsquo;by hand&rsquo;. In other words, the numerical value of this is based on sensible choices given expert opinion.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In a more developed version of the model, these assumptions would be driven by data. For example, the rate of birth of new companies can be calculated from business surveys. Constructing the model therefore also gives us insight in to new types of data that can inform our policy question. One observation is that useful information to collect form large data holders would be the relative size of companies that successfully request access to their data.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Crucially, the structure of the model also has assumptions in it, again driven by ODI and others&rsquo; expertise, with guidance from Sandtable. <strong>These assumptions are there to simplify the real-world situation to a point where it can be modelled to answer the policy question.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Assumptions beyond the strengths of different characteristics in decisions can be tricky to spot. Some examples are:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- We assume that companies don&rsquo;t develop products until they&rsquo;ve gotten confirmed access to the data.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- New companies randomly decide what products they&rsquo;re going to make, with no attention given to consumers&rsquo; needs - so we don&rsquo;t have market research in our model.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- The chances of creating a product in a category other companies are already making products are the same as creating a product in a brand new category altogether.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">- Consumers make decisions on the types of products they use based on inherent needs that aren&rsquo;t influenced by anything companies do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As this is an early-stage model, instead of simplifying these assumptions may be critical. In other words, they have an impact on how data sharing affects innovation.</p><p>A key purpose of developing our model further and testing it against real-world data would be to discover whether our assumptions are simplifying or critical. This is a crucial step in building a model that would be able to predict the effect of different policies.</p>",

Questions around who designs the standards and who grants access to data are still to be resolved.

The housing market is a complex set of feedback loops between owner-occupiers, Buy-to-Let landlords, renters and social housing tenants, so understanding the impact of this policy is a challenge using traditional economic modelling techniques. Researchers at the Institute of New Economic Thinking and the Bank of England built an agent-based model in order to understand how house prices might be affected by different policies. They found that limiting the number of high loan-to-income mortgages did make house prices more stable.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2016/macroprudential-policy-in-an-agent-based-model-of-the-uk-housing-market.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">More information</a></p>",

They used an agent-based model to move beyond economic analyses of individual projects to understand why small projects weren&rsquo;t scaling. This involved modelling how the different abilities and motives of local authorities, private developers and community groups, constrained by technical and social factors, affects the success of a large infrastructure projects. They found that supporting learning and networking between these groups and boosting local authorities capabilities could be particularly important.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516305560?via%3Dihub#\" target=\"_blank\">More information</a></p>",

The horizontal lines plotted on the graph represent the maximum quality available in the product categories. The product categories are ordered horizontally by how many consumers are using them, a way of testing how &lsquo;useful&rsquo; they are to consumers in the simulation. This plot therefore shows us whether the most used product categories have the highest quality products - in other words, whether innovation is making products that people really want better.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Graph 1 - low vs medium</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Graph 2 - medium vs high</p>",
