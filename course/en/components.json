These include agent characteristics, previous decisions by other agents and the environment of the model. </strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Whether a company requests data from another depends on how much the types that they currently have access to overlap. Whether a company grants a data request depends on how big the requester is in terms of users, how much they are competing in the same categories and how much the overall environment encourages open data sharing. The success of companies&rsquo; attempts to improve their existing products depends on the data and the amount of capital that they have access to. The probability of creating new products also depends on how good the company is at innovation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Consumers make purchasing decisions based on the &lsquo;utility&rsquo; they get from products - a combination of inherent needs and perceptions of companies. Firstly, they decide on what categories they&rsquo;ll purchase products from based on their entry in the model&rsquo;s category-needs matrix, which is the same for every tick cycle. They then choose a product based on the companies providing them in that category. This is based on whether they are already using that company&rsquo;s product or other products from that company in other categories, how much they care about privacy and the company&rsquo;s reputation on privacy and their perception of how easy it is to share their data from that product with other companies.</p>",
